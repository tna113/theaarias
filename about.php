            <p class="description">My name is Thea Arias and if you didn't read the subtitle on the front page, I'm an aspiring web developer! I am currently a Web & Mobile Computing student at Rochester Institute of Technology and will be graduating in the fall semester of December 2023.</p>
            <p class="description">On my free time, I like to take pictures, make videos, casually browse the web, listen to music, curate custom playlists, create collage CD covers, play videogames, longboard, snowboard, travel, read, hike, cook and spend time with family and close friends. You can find me at any time of any day holding a cup of frozen/iced coffee.</p>
